Go to the root folder and run `yarn start` or `npm start`

**NOTE :** Its neccesary has the server running before [Check it!](http:localhost:7000/health)\

# FRONTEND - extra features

> Formatter script ( prettier )

> Linter (eslint)

> Unit Test (jest + enzyme)

## 'Cool Features' that I would have liked to do:

> FRONTEND -> storybook and e2e tests with cypress ( out scope)

> FRONTEND -> use react@next (userReducer + another react hooks and features instead of redux, redux-saga, etc.) ( out scope )

> SSR(Server side rendering) with NEXT.js / Gatsby instead of express + react separately ( could be the better solution for this kind of tests)
